                                <b>Description:</b> Our website aims to raise awareness about Canadaâ€™s 
                                water crisis and its profound impact on indigenous communities, including 
                                those in rural areas. We engage users through interactive games that not
                                 only educate but also encourage meaningful community involvement. 
                                 Furthermore, we have also included research sections, which more deeply 
                                 describe the primitive situations people are living as a result of water 
                                 insecurity. To further our cause, we would ideally partner with an NGO deeply 
                                 committed to supporting indigenous communities. By highlighting their initiatives on 
                                 our website, we showcase their direct impact on the water crisis and inspire others to take action.

                                <b>Description:</b>  The front face of the console contains all of the
                                  interactive components of the game, including 5 buttons, a potentiometer,
                                   the seven segment display and the screen. This design is also inspired
                                    from that of the original two-player game. The console has a compact design
                                     where all of the circuitry fits nicely on the inside, which was 
                                     important considering this is an on the go console, so this design decision 
                                     permits the circuitry to remain well connected. The code contains all seven mini games,
                                      and five of this will be randomly selected and ordered. On the initial menu, the player
                                       will be able to choose difficulty, which is a function of the time available for 
                                       the player to finish the games. For the easy mode players get 5 minutes and 2.30 and  
                                       1.25 minutes are available for the intermediate and hard levels respectively.
